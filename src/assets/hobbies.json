So cooking is 'the act of preparing food for eating especially by heating : the act of cooking food'. I don't really cook a lot of sweets and desserts - and prefer to cook savory. Why? I think I'm better at eyeballing things, and the precise mesurements of pastry drives me crazy.", 
        "enjoy": "I've learned cooking while in Australia when I was 17. I was living in a host family, where we were up to 12 at times. My cooking was really impacted by that: I always cook too much, but I also cook for others and the joy of hosting. There were a lot of students from Asia (Korea, Japan, Thailand...) living with me, and it's also a key part of my cooking: cooking is a way of traveling and discovering cultures.",
