        "definition" : "Bouldering is a form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. It’s not to be confused with “Lead” climbing (with giant walls), and you’ll never catch me higher than 4 meters off the ground. In a climbing gym, a ‘route setter’ creates a ‘problem’ (some technically harder part of a route) for you to play around.",
        "enjoy": "I think bouldering is one of the most ‘complete’ sport there is: it’s a whole body sport, involving every muscles and core, while necessitating to think about your movements (and some flexibility), it’s a social sport, where you’ll very easily talk to someone working on the same route as you, and finally it’s an intellectual challenge (a puzzle) to solve the problem created by the setter.",

        "definition" : "It sounds weird to explain 'cooking', but one of the joy of software development is having to match your type against a lot of instances. So cooking is 'the act of preparing food for eating especially by heating : the act of cooking food'. I don't really cook a lot of sweets and desserts - and prefer to cook savory. Why? I think I'm better at eyeballing things, and the precise mesurements of pastry drives me crazy.", 
        "enjoy": "I've learned cooking while in Australia when I was 17. I was living in a host family, where we were up to 12 at times. My cooking was really impacted by that: I always cook too much, but I also cook for others and the joy of hosting. There were a lot of students from Asia (Korea, Japan, Thailand...) living with me, and it's also a key part of my cooking: cooking is a way of traveling and discovering cultures.",
